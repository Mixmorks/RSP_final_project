# Turtlebot Teaming 

## Objective 

This project shows how two turtlebots can cooperate with each other to finish a task.

- Turtlebot3 Burger: The Burger bot wants to go to a target destination on a platform. However, it has to pass through a gap to achieve that. As soon as Burger reaches the gap, it request Waffle for help, wait until Waffle sucessfully finishes its task and continues driving to reach its destination.
- Turtlebot3 Waffle: The Waffle bot stays on the ground until it receives a “help” message from Burger. Then, it will navigate to the gap, push the box to fill the gap, and will drive back to its starting position.

# Package Info


## `final_project`

This package contains the main launch files that are used to launch simulation in ignition gazebo  or to control the real robots. The `urdf` folder contains all xacro files used to spawn waffle and burger in ignition gazebo. Note that you will not need these urdfs files for the real robots.  The config files that nav2 uses are located in `param` folder. By default, `waffle.yaml` is used for simulation and `waffle_real.yaml` is used to navigate the real Waffle. `rviz` file has all the rviz configurations used for the simulations and real robots. All map files are stored in `map` folder. If you want to create your own map, we suggest you to store your map files under this folder. 


## `ign_gazebo`

This package contains meshes and models for the Aruco AR markers and entities in the world for ignition gazebo simulation. You can change the world by changing the `bot_world.xacro` in `urdf` file. You can add your own markers by importing the meshes and models into this package.   

## `maze_msgs`

All the source files required to run the actions that enable this team task are located in [this package](https://github.com/Mixmorks/RSP_final_project/tree/main/maze_msgs). This package has an `action` directory that contains the goal, result and feedback information for all the actions used for the project. 


## `navtopose`

The navtopose package can be used to send a target location to waffle. There are two ways to set a goal pose through nav2 - one is to use the Nav2Goal option in Rviz while running the simulation and the second one is to utilize this package to set the goal.

## `turtlebot_actionlib`

The turtblebot_actionlib package contains multiple action servers and clients that execute the actions in `maze_msgs`. It has three nodes: 'maze', 'waffle',and 'burger',and their relationship shown in [action diagram](./docs/action_diagrampng.png). To run the simulation and real robot separately, what you need to do is tuning the parameters in ![maze_client.cpp](./turtlebot_actionlib/src/maze_client.cpp). 


# Simulation
## Mapping 

SLAM toolbox was used to create the map. Follow the instructions in this section to generate a map. 

1.  Run the `simulation_draw_map.launch` file in a new terminal.
    
        ros2 launch final_project simulation_draw_map.launch
    
This launch file will start up rviz and use waffle&rsquo;s lidar data to create a map. It also starts up a teleop node that allows users to drive around in their simualtion world. The map will update periodically in rviz while the waffle is moving.
    
2.  Save the map. Open a brand new terminal and run the map saver command.
    
        ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f <path/to/save/your/map>
    
This command saves map files to a user defined path. For example, if you want to save the map files under you home directory. You can run
    
        ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map

Note: The map saver command saves two files on your PC. You can visualize your map in &ldquo;map.pgm&rdquo;. The &ldquo;map.yaml&rdquo; file contains some parameters and the path to your &ldquo;map.pgm&rdquo; file. If you want to load your map into rviz, you might want to change your &ldquo;pgm&rdquo; file&rsquo;s path in the &ldquo;yaml&rdquo; file so that rviz can find and load your map correctly. You can `Ctrl+C` to stop the `simulation_draw_map.launch` that is running once you save the map. 

## Visualize the teaming on ignition gazebo and rviz

1.  To launch the simulation with predefined worlds and parameter, you can 
    
        ros2 launch final_project maze_action_simulation.launch

2.  Open a new terminal and run the following command. This command initiates the process of Burger driving, and starts communication between the two bots.
    
        ros2 run turtlebot_actionlib client
        
Map and Waffle in Rviz     |  Bots in Ignition Gazebo
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](./docs/sim_gazebo.png) |  ![](./docs/sim_rviz.png)

The lidar on Waffle scans the world to create a map and localize itself. Whereas Burger scans the Aruco AR markers using its camera to localize itself.  
        
![](./docs/action_diagrampng.png) 


3. Burger localization depends on the `ros2_aruco` package. This package locates Aruco AR markers in images and publishes their ids and poses. 
- Node `aruco_node`
- Subscribes to 
    `/camera/image_raw`
    `/camera/camera_info` 
- Publishes 
    `/aruco_poses` 
    `/aruco_markers`
`/aruco_markers` gives the pose of the AR tag relative to the camera link on Burger bot. 

4. #TODO Add nodes, published topics and subscriptions to expect from action files and important nav2 files. 

## Troubleshooting

1. If the simulation does not start automatically once you launch `maze_action_simulation.launch`, click on the hamburger icon on the right corner of the ignition gazebo window and search for 'Image display'. Once you scroll down this panel you should be able to see what Burger's camera is seeing. Make sure that you see the AR tag. To verify this you can echo `\burger_camera` topic to see Burger's camera is sending out images. In another terminal echo `/aruco_markers` to see if the AR tag is being detected. If Burger's camera is running, `\aruco_markers` should work. If the frame rate of `\burger_camera` is too slow, then it was found that `\aruco_markers` does not echo anything.

# On the real bots 
## Mapping the environment
Please drive waffle through the environment to create a 2D map!
1. ssh into waffle.
2. On waffle, run
    
        ros2 launch final_project waffle_setup.launch.py

3. On your PC, start the SLAM node by
    
        ros2 launch final_project turtlebot_draw_map.launch

4. To save your map, run
    
        ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f <path/to/save/your/map>
    
You can close all the terminals after your map is saved!

## Waffle-burger cooperation task

1. Setting up waffle and burger. 
   On your PC, open a terminal and ssh to waffle. Then run,
    
        ros2 launch final_project waffle_setup.launch.py

   On your PC, open another terminal and ssh to burger. Then run,
    
        ros2 launch final_project burger_setup.launch.py

   Note: it is common to have errors related to the `v4l2` package on burger. This package deals with Logitech Webcam, since the default Raspberry Pi Camera module did not work for Ubuntu 20.04! Once everything is up and running, you should see something similar to the screenshot below.
![](./docs/Turtlebot_Running.png) 
2. On your PC, open up a terminal and run the `real_world_multibots.launch` file.
   Go to your workspace and source the corresponding `.sh` file.
    
        cd <YOUR/WORKSPACE>
        source install/setup.bash

   Then,
    
        ros2 launch final_project real_world_multibots.launch

3. Before you correctly give it a initial pose estimation, the map sensed by waffle may not overlap with the map you created previously like the figure shown below.
 FIGURE HERE！！！
![](./docs/rviz_pre_initial_pose.png) 
   
   You will need `rqt` gui to set initial pose. Open up a new terminal, and then type
    
        rqt

   The following window will show up.
![](./docs/rqt_initialpose.png) 

   Then under `Plugin` tab, select `Topics` > `Message Publisher`. Then in the drop down menu of `Topic`, select `/initialpose`. Its type is set to `geometry_msgs/msg/PointWithCovarianceStamped` by default. By clicking the `+` button, you can edit the pose and covriance and enter the initial pose esitmation and the covariance. To run our task for our specific map, we suggest you to enter the following values to the initial pose.
   - Under `header`, change `frame_id` to `'map'`;
   - Under `pose` > `pose` > `position`, change `x` to `0.152`, `y` to `-0.0101`;
   - Under `pose` > `pose` > `orientation`, change `z` to `0.315`, `w` to `0.949`;
   - Under `pose` > `covariance`, change `[0]` to `0.05`, `[7]` to `0.05`, `[35]` to `0.05`.
   
   After you enter the initial pose and covariance, check the box in front of the `/initialpose`, to publish it. Then, in rviz, your waffle's sensed map will overlap with the loaded map and you'll be able to see the paricles around the robot from the Monte Carlo localization that Nav2 does. Now, you can uncheck the box in `rqt` to stop publishing it. If the particles seem too dispersed you can play around with the values of covariances for x, y, yaw. NOTE: it is crucial to stop publishing the initial pose before you run the following commands!
![](./docs/rviz_post_initial_pose.png) 
4. Open a new terminal to run server.
    
        cd <YOUR/WORKSPACE>
        source install/setup.bash
        ros2 run turtlebot_actionlib server

5. Open a new terminal to run robot client.
    
        cd <YOUR/WORKSPACE>
        source install/setup.bash
        ros2 run turtlebot_actionlib robot_client

Then you will see waffle and burger cooperating with each other to finish task!
