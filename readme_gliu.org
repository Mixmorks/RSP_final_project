#+title: Project README org
* Introduction
This project shows how two turtlebots can cooperate with each other to finish a task.
- Turtlebot3 Burger: The burger bot wants to go to a target destination. However, it has to pass through a gap to achieve that. The gap is sufficiently wide so that without the aid from waffle bot, it will never reach its target. Therefore, when it reaches the gap, it will wait and requests help from waffle until the gap is filled.
- Turtlebot3 Waffle: The waffle bot stays on the ground until it receives a "help" message from burger. Then, it will navigate to the gap and push a box to fill the gap to allow the burger bot pass through.
* Installation
Here are some essential packages to install on your PC. Taking ROS Galactic as an example,
1. Cartographer
   #+begin_src shell
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-cartographer
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-cartographer-ros
   #+end_src
2. Nav2
   #+begin_src shell
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-navigation2
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-nav2-bringup
   #+end_src
3. Turtlebot3 packages
   #+begin_src shell
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-dynamixel-sdk
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-turtlebot3-msgs
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-turtlebot3
   #+end_src

* Simulation
** Mapping
We use the SLAM toolbox to create a map.
1. Create a simulation scene in ignition gazebo. For example, our scene looks like this.
#+CAPTION: Simulation Opening in ignition Gazebo
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100px
[[/./docs/sim_gazebo.png]]
1. Run the =simulation_draw_map.launch= file in a new terminal.
   #+begin_src shell
ros2 launch final_project simulation_draw_map.launch
   #+end_src
   This launch file will start up rviz and use waffle's lidar data to create a map. It also starts up a teleop node that allows users to drive around in their simualtion world. The map will update periodically in rviz while the waffle is moving.
2. Save the map. Open a brand new terminal and run the map saver command.
   #+begin_src shell
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f <path/to/save/your/map>
   #+end_src
   This command saves map files to a user defined path. For example, if you want to save the map files under you home directory. You can run
   #+begin_src shell
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
   #+end_src

Note: the map saver command saves two files on your PC. You can visualize your map in "map.pgm". The "map.yaml" file contains some parameters and the path to your "map.pgm" file. If you want to load your map into rviz, you might want to change your "pgm" file's path in the "yaml" file so that rviz can find and load your map correctly.
* Package Info
** =final_project=
This package contains the main launch files that used to launch simulation in gazebo or to control the physical robots. The =urdf= folder contains all xacro files used to spawn waffle and burger in ignition gazebo. The config files used by nav2 are located in =param= folder. By default, =waffle.yaml= is used for simulation and =waffle_real.yaml= is used to navigate the real waffle. All map files are stored in =map= folder. If you want to create your own map, we suggest you to store your map files under this folder.
** =ign_gazebo=
This package is used to spawn the simulation world file in ignition gazebo.
** =navtopose=
The navtopose package can be used to sending a target location to waffle. If you want to navigate waffle to a specific location via nav2, you can utilize this package to send the goal instead of pointing out the goal in rviz. In our case, this package is called by the =turtlebot_actionlib= package.
** =maze_msgs=
** =turtlebot_actionlib=
